            <p> I'm from Volcano, Hawaii and am currently in my second year here at Eastern. I am a Visual Communication Design major and a Computer Science Web application Minor. If all goes well I am hoping to graduate June 2019 with the hopes of moving back to Hawaii, or somewhere along the West Coast. </p>
