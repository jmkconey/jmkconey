        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> I'm from Volcano, Hawaii and am currently in my second year here at Eastern. I am a Visual Communication Design major and a Computer Science Web application Minor. If all goes well I am hoping to graduate June 2019 with the hopes of moving back to Hawaii, or somewhere along the West Coast. </p>
        <h3>Goals and Aspirations</h3>
             <p>I would say currently in my life my biggest goal is to graduate college in good standing with the high hopes of finding a job right after. I hope to one day become a web designer and use everything i've learned from college to the best of my sbility. </p>
        <h3>Favorite Book </h3>
             <h4><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BFG-Roald-Dahl/dp/0142410381/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1475543988&sr=8-1&keywords=the+bfg+book">The BFG</h4>
            <p> Although a kids book, the BFG would have to be my favorite book because as a child I was always one of the worst readers in my class discouraging me from wanting to read on my own. In third grade our assistant teacher read the BFG to us during story time and I fell in love with it. I found the book at home and proceeded to read it over and over again. Since then I have never loved a book so much that I wanted to read it more then once therefore making the BFG my absolute favorite.  </p>
